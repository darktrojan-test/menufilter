# Menu Filter

This is the Menu Filter add-on for Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. You can get it from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/menu-filter/).

## Localization

You might be here because you'd like to see Open With in your language. Great!

To translate, you can:

* Fork this Git repository, translate, and send me a pull request. Some knowledge of creating Mozilla add-ons is required.
* Or, visit [the project's page on Zoo](https://zoo2translate.herokuapp.com/darktrojan/menufilter), a website for add-on translation. (Please note that Zoo is under development, and could break at any time. It's mostly stable though.)

## Donate

Your donations make future development possible. To donate by either PayPal or BitCoin, see [this page](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/menu-filter/contribute/installed/) for details. Thank you!
